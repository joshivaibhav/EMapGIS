#GIS Automation Tool and Map Rendering
This is the code for the project undertaken at my internship at Bhaskaracharya Institute of Space and Geoinformatics (BISAG), Gandhinagar.

This project is divded into two phases : 

Phase 0: Developing a web based tool for automating the functionalities of Geoserver - A map rendering software extensively used by BISAG scientists. 
Motivation : Geoserver although is a very robust tool itself working with it can get tedious sometimes. In order to render a map there are lots of processes to be followed such as creating a wrokspace, importing the .shp(shapefile), setting constraints etc. Thus, in order to expediate this process a tool was to be designed.
